Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room was a client who wanted to devolop a java based game that would allow multiple teams of players interact for their game "draw it or loose it".  This game would have players attempt to guess what a drawn item was before it was completed.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
In developing this documentation, I think I did a good job in utilizing real life scenarios and provided experience that I took from my employer and work to help in finding interesting ways to complete the work.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The design doc was helpful in streamlining thoughts and keeping focused on the goal.  This was very helpful when coding as when the end goal is clear, code is easier to write.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I wish I did more on the evaluation side.  I needed to add more details to make that section more impactful.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
When interpreting the needs of the client, I used my experience to try to descern what was needed to acheive the required output from the program.  WHen the user has needs it is important to provide them with a product they are happy with too.  Following the requirements is much different that providing them with a product that will make them happy.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
in this application, I was very rusty with OOP.  In the future.  I would like to brush up on the things I need to do to understand this better.
